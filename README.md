# MSDM5001
HW1
The codes I uploaded are about the Q2 and Q3 in the assignment 1, and the Q1 codes are all in the report. TA can follow the codes in the report in terminal and get the result I got in the report.

Q2:
TA can:
(1) move the 'MSDMHW1.2' to the Linux Desktop;
(2) open a terminal and type the following codes:
    cd /Desktop
    chmod 777 MSDMHW1.2
    ./MSDMHW1.2
(3) then there should be a 'MSDMHW1' file created on the Desktop and the file contains files 'DDM1,DDM2,...,DDM100' which satisfy the assignment request.

Q3:
There was something wrong when name the two scripts uploaded and their names are not in the same form, but it seems to be no problem when I run them in my Linux system.
TA can:
(1) move the 'MSDMHW1.3.1.sh' and 'MSDMHW1.3.2' and 'blocklist.xml' to the Linux Desktop;
(2) open a terminal and type the following codes:
    cd /Desktop
    chmod 777 MSDMHW1.2.1.sh
    ./MSDMHW1.3.1.sh
(3) then the terminal screen should show the result satisfying the Q3.1's request;
(4) type the following codes in the terminal:
    chmod 777 MSDMHW1.3.2
    ./MSDMHW1.3.2
(5) then the terminal screen should show the result satisfying the Q3.2's request.
